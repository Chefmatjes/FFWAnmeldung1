# Signature Component Implementation

## Overview
A signature field component has been added to the registration form to replace the text fields for signatures. This allows users to draw their signature directly on the form.

## Installation Requirements
To make the signature component fully functional, you need to install the following package:

```bash
npm install react-signature-canvas --save
```

## Activation Steps

1. After installing the package, open `src/components/RegistrationForm.jsx`
2. Uncomment the import line for the SignatureCanvas component:
   ```javascript
   // Uncomment this line:
   import SignatureCanvas from 'react-signature-canvas';
   ```

## Features
- Draw signature directly on the form
- Clear button to reset signatures
- Validation support
- Converts signatures to data URLs for submission
- Responsive design that works on both desktop and mobile

## How It Works
The SignatureField component creates a canvas where users can draw their signature. When the form is submitted, the signature is converted to a data URL (base64 image) which can be sent to the server.

## Customization
You can customize the signature field by modifying the following properties in the SignatureField component:

- `penColor`: Change the color of the signature (default: "black")
- `canvasProps.height`: Adjust the height of the signature area
- Styling: Modify the CSS styles for `.signature-pad` and `.signature-pad-error`
